# PROrgsAirtables

* Uses NginX PHP FPM Docker image to run https://github.com/richarvey/nginx-php-fpm
* Uses Composer to get libraries http://getcomposer.org
* Uses Airtable PHP to read from Airtables https://github.com/sleiman/airtable-php

You just need to copy this code to /var/www/html, figure out your API KEY and API BASE ID and put it as the AIRTABLE_API_KEY and AIRTABLE_BASE_ID vars and it will run.
